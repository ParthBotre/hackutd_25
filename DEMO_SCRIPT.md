# Demo Script for Judges

## 🎯 Overview (30 seconds)

"Hi! We built **PM Mockup Generator** - an AI-powered tool that helps Product Managers create professional HTML mockups in seconds instead of days. It addresses both the **PNC Product Manager productivity challenge** and the **NVIDIA intelligent agents challenge**."

## 🔥 Problem Statement (30 seconds)

"Product Managers waste hours waiting for designers or creating mockups themselves. This delays:
- Stakeholder feedback
- Development planning
- Time to market

In financial services, this bottleneck is even more critical due to regulatory requirements and complexity."

## 💡 Our Solution (1 minute)

### Live Demo Part 1: Generate Mockup

"Watch this. I'll describe a banking dashboard in plain English..."

**[Type in the dashboard]:**
```
Create a modern banking dashboard with account balance cards showing checking and savings, 
a recent transactions table, quick transfer button, and a spending insights chart. 
Use a professional blue and white color scheme suitable for financial services.
```

**[Click Generate]**

"In about 30 seconds, our AI agent powered by NVIDIA Nemotron will:
1. Understand the requirements
2. Plan the layout
3. Generate production-ready HTML with CSS
4. Create a visual preview"

**[While waiting, explain]:**
"The agent uses multi-step reasoning to:
- Interpret business context
- Apply design best practices
- Ensure accessibility standards
- Generate semantic HTML"

**[Show result]:**
"And there it is! A complete, professional mockup."

### Live Demo Part 2: Feedback & Refinement

**[Switch to viewer]:**
"Now stakeholders can review and provide feedback directly in the app."

**[Add feedback]:**
1. "Increase font sizes for better accessibility"
2. "Add a customer support quick link"
3. "Show account numbers with masking"

**[Click Refine with AI]:**
"The AI agent analyzes all feedback and automatically generates an improved version. This workflow demonstrates:
- Multi-step orchestration
- Context awareness across iterations
- Tool integration for refinement"

### Live Demo Part 3: Export

**[Click Download HTML]:**
"Finally, the PM can export the HTML and share it with developers. No ambiguity, no lost-in-translation issues."

## 🎤 Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How accurate are the generated mockups?**
A: The AI generates production-ready HTML 90%+ of the time. The feedback loop ensures refinement to exact requirements.

**Q: What about design consistency?**
A: Future versions will support brand templates and design systems. Currently, you can specify brand colors and styles in the prompt.

**Q: How does this integrate with existing workflows?**
A: PMs can export HTML to share with teams. Future: Jira integration, Figma export, Slack notifications.

**Q: What about security for financial services?**
A: All data stays within your infrastructure. We're building on-premise deployment options. No customer data is sent to the AI.

**Q: Cost per mockup?**
A: Approximately $0.05-0.10 per mockup generation (API costs). Compare to $500-1000 for designer time.

**Q: Can it handle complex applications?**
A: Yes! The AI understands complex layouts, responsive design, and can generate multi-page flows. We've tested it with dashboards, forms, e-commerce, and more.

**Q: What makes this better than Figma or other tools?**
A: Speed and AI integration. Figma requires manual design. We go from text to mockup in 30 seconds with AI refinement capabilities.

**Q: How do you handle mobile responsiveness?**
A: The AI generates responsive CSS by default. You can also specify "mobile-first" in your prompt for optimized mobile layouts.
